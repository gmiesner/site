The web application aims to improve the online learning experience. I contributed auto updating graphs for the website to mimic what assignment analytics would look like. I used python and matplotlib create the data visualizations, and created a python script to generate dummy student score data as we did not have any on hand. Neurosight won best survival hack at TechTogether New York.</p>

The websites serve as a tier ranking application for the Missouri University of Science and Technology students and the University of Missouri students to tier rank their classes - both past and present. As I knew next to no React, I learned a little bit to refactor the project for the Missouri schools. I also learned how to use the puppeteer library in JavaScript to web scrape all the classes off of the Missouri S & T and Mizzou websites.</p>
