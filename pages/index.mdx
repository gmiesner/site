## MizTier
MizTier was inspired by Kat's [website](https://mitier.vercel.app) for MIT. The website serves as a tier ranking application for the University of Missouri students to tier rank their classes - both past and present. As I knew next to no React, I learned a little bit to refactor the project for the new school. I also learned how to use the puppeteer library in JavaScript to web scrape all the classes off of the Mizzou website Before creating this website, I scraped the class data and made a different version of it, for [Missouri S & T](https://mstier.vercel.app).

## NeuroSight
Neurosight is a project built over the course of [Tech Together](https://techtogether.io) New York. The web application aims to improve the online learning experience. I contributed auto updating graphs for the website to mimic what assignment analytics would look like. I used python and matplotlib create the data visualizations, and created a python script to generate dummy student score data as we did not have any on hand. Neurosight won best survival hack at TechTogether New York.
